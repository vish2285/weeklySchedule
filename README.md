# WeeklySchedule
* I created this weekly schedule website since I couldn't find a website that matched my exact timing and personalization. Other websites required you to adjust everything yourself, which was not suitable for me
* I aim to improve this as my knowledge grows.
* This project currently only supports a clear view of the iPad Air and huge screens.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
